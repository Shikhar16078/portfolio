- Background color: Dark gray (#222222) for the dark theme, and light gray (#f0f0f0) for the light theme.
- Primary color: Vibrant red (#E44D26) for accents and highlights. Red was chosen to highlight the skills of a high performing software engineer. A dash of unexpected style indicates their cutting-edge ability.
- Accent color: Analogous orange (#FF8533), a brighter, more saturated complement to the primary red, used for buttons and interactive elements. An intense accent reflects the applicant's high energy.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for a modern and clean look. This will be used for both headers and body text. This versatile choice helps achieve a contemporary feel for all elements, and keep the design clean.
- Simple, line-based icons for skills and social media links.
- Use a clean and responsive layout with clear sections for each category.
- Subtle transitions for theme switching and hover effects.
